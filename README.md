Purify is a single-player Top-Down, Territorial-Control game. The player controls a little priest in a post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious force has been defiling the land and he wishes to cleanse the world of it. The priest has to stop the spread by growing purified land. The purified land sprouts magical Mana potions which are crucial in equipping the priest to defeat the enemies that get in his way. The game ends when the priest completely purifies the land and defeats the ultimate enemy, The Defiler. This game is appealing to players who enjoy area control games with some combat.
